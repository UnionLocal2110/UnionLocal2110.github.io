        <h1>Progress Report</h1>
        <p>This week I made storymaps for each industry of workplace unionized with Local 2110. We are also working on a twine, in which we will put each storymap as users interact with info about each industry.</p>
        <p>4/3 Today I included Tyler's Twine link as seen above, which will be the interactive aspect we're sharing during our presentation. I was also able to embed the Twine as an iframe element on the main page. </p>
        <p>I deleted the individual story maps from the main page because they are integrated into the Twine. Tyler has been updating the Twine to include images, and we will also integrate our video/audio interviews into our Twine and the text within it.</p>
        <p>4/22 I added the main menu to our home page and created a separate HTML page for our progress report. I included the main menu nav bar in our twine HTML as well, so now it is in two locations on the home page, so we need to decide which we prefer.</p>

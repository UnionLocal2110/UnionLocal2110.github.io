        <h2 class="prhead">Our approach to The 2110 Portal</h2>

            <p class="printro">The 2110 Portal began with the idea to highlight workplaces within United Auto Workers Union (UAW) Local 2110, as it is an influential union within the New York City area that represents workers from over 40 workplaces and spans multiple industries and types of cultural institutions. (View UAW 2110’s list of workplaces here.) UAW Local 2110 has been involved in many recent unionization efforts within the city, some influenced by the pandemic, and all by the various needs of today’s workforce. Our website hopes to answer the question of why cultural institutions seek unionization and how demands of different industries within Local 2110 compare.</p>
            
            <p class="printro">As we began the process of creating our first interactive digital piece of journalism, we based much of our thinking off of the key takeaways in the MIT Open Documentary Lab report, “Mapping the Intersection of Two Cultures: Interactive Documentary and Digital Journalism.” The takeaways that influenced our project most were the following:</p>
    </br>
            <p class="printro">Let story determine form (Urrichio, 6)</p>
            <p class="printro">We wanted our website to be as engaging on a human and emotional level as possible. Unionization is at its heart the standing together of a group of people. Although there is much data associated with this story, especially when analyzing union agreements, we wanted the user to come away with an experience of the people who are making advancement of workplace rights possible. To do so, we decided to embed audio clips of our interviewees throughout the narrative on our website, in hopes of actively reminding the reader who they are reading about as they consume the information.</p>
    </br>
            <p class="printro">Experiment and learn (Urrichio, 6)</p>
            <p class="printro">The most time-consuming aspect of this project was learning how to use interactive tools to accomplish our goals. We mainly used Twine, Soundcite, and StoryMap, but we also had a learning curve implementing certain aspects of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, now that we have gone through the process of making this project, it will be much easier to incorporate these skills into future journalistic endeavors.</p>
    </br>
            <p class="printro">Shape conversations and Consider long-term impact (Urrichio, 6)</p>
            <p class="printro">UAW Local 2110 covers many industries, yet their site does not sort workplaces by industry or need. As seen in unionization trends throughout the past few years, when employees at one workplace accomplish a goal like getting higher pay or receiving health insurance, there is often a trickle effect once other workplaces learn of what is accomplished. We wanted to provide a source that breaks down needs and gives insight into the unionization process by industry. The hope is that those who are looking to unionize in their workplace, or even those who are not, will be able to read about the needs and accomplishments of their industry and enact change in their own workplace in an informed manner. We also hope this site makes unionization seem less intimidating and more possible for users to implement in their own lives, grounded in the human experience as it is.</p>
    </br>
        <h2 class="prhead">Our process creating The 2110 Portal</h2>
            <h4 class="prhead">Collecting Raw Material and Soundcite Audio Clips</h4>
            <p class="printro">We began the process of collecting audio by researching the workplaces and industries represented by UAW Local 2110 and contacting union representatives or workers who had recently unionized. We decided to focus on recently unionized workplaces to highlight the current trends and needs of workers. Audio interviews were conducted with workers from the New Museum of Contemporary Art, Barnard Contingent Faculty, and HarperCollins Publishers to represent the arts industry, academia, and the media industry respectively. Topics of interest included motivation to unionize, process and outcomes of unionization, remaining needs, and changes to be made in the larger industry.</p>
            
            <p class="printro">These interviews were edited into clips and published to Internet Archive, and the program Soundcite was used to create code for inline audio players for each clip. The clips were incorporated into articles on each industry’s page on Twine for the user to listen to while reading about the industry.</p>
            
            <p class="printro">Videos and photos of each workplace were collected and incorporated into the Twine pages of each industry to help place the reader in the location.</p>

                        <ul class="blocktext">
                            <li>TB: Created a story board for our project’s Twine:</li> 
                                <p id="storyboard"><a href="https://ibb.co/0QM2TqM"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/3kNd21N/UAW-Local-2110-Interactive-Website-Story-Board-1.png" alt="UAW-Local-2110-Interactive-Website-Story-Board-1" border="0"></a></p>
                            <li>EB: I made storymaps for each industry of workplace unionized with Local 2110. We are also working on a twine, in which we will put each storymap as users interact with info about each industry.</li>
                            <li>TB: Began building a Twine structured by the pages outlined in the image above - Chapter I: Intro, Chapter II: The Pandemic’s Effects, Chapter III: The Arts Industry, Chapter IV: Academia, Chapter V: The Media Industry, and Chapter VI: Predictions + Conclusions.</li>
                            <li>TB: Drafted the copy for each Twine page which is accessible via <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RWlr3mnlKUhbjOnYEwjGRwrNXyCpEInM_ue9IfPWKQw/edit?usp=share_link">this link</a></li>
                            <li></li>

                    <h4 class="blocktext">APRIL</h4>
                        <ul class="blocktext">
                            <li>EB: I included Tyler's first Twine link, which will be the interactive aspect we're sharing during our presentation. I played around with a few different ways to embed the twine and I was also able to embed the Twine as an iframe element on the main page. </li>
                            <li>TB: Downloaded archival content, began logging retrieved content in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fWC5E859C2DBbvjDcyyFRojUkiStYntchAkR8wm5y38/edit?usp=sharing">this spreadsheet</a>, and embedded images into the site. </li>
                            <li>EB: I deleted the individual story maps from the main page because they are integrated into the Twine. Tyler has been updating the Twine to include images, and we will also integrate our video/audio interviews into our Twine and the text within it. I’ve also started collecting data from the union agreements available on Local 2110’s site to better understand what goes into a union agreement and what are common articles among this union’s contracts.</li>
                            <li>TB: Created and embedded the site header through Canva. Learned how to resize images and enhance image quality, and change font size to improve emphasis and how the site text reads.</li>
                            <li>EB: [after class feedback] I added the main menu to our home page and created a separate HTML page for our progress report. I’ve added the navbar to our home page as well as the separate pages for the twine and progress report.</li>
                            <li>TB: Added image citations and embedded interactive audio elements into the Twine.</li>
                            <li>EB: Throughout the semester I have been collecting data from the first union agreements of each workplace unionized with Local 2110 to understand what generally goes into a union agreement within our industries of focus. I compiled that data to find the most common articles within the union agreements and created an interactive graph using Flourish <a href src=”https://flourish.studio/”>Flourish</a> to visualize the most common articles. The data in this graph was compiled within <a href=”https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w84WVDk2UVN5vGkxDFaKJQ8272iRond_wTbBHs0GOnY/edit?usp=share_link”>this Google Sheet.</a></li>
                            <li></li>

                    <h4 class="blocktext">MAY</h4>
                        <ul class="blocktext">
                            <li>EB: I’ve made general updates to the HTML and CSS regarding general design and organization of our information. </li>
                            <li>TB: Synthesized the Workplace needs information to make and embed two Flourish graphs for the ‘Predictions + Conclusions’ page.</li>
                            <li>EB: I’ve updated the storymaps with a simple description of the workplace and the list of terms of union agreements with Local 2110. Also, in response to our feedback, I included links to the union agreements as well as links to the workplaces’ websites on all of the storymaps. </li>
                            <li>EB: I worked to resolve the issue of changing URLs pointed out by Professor Nassiri during our feedback and moved our navbar menu to the top of our home page instead of below our header gif.</li>

                <li>EB: [after spring break] I made storymaps for each industry of workplace unionized with Local 2110. We are also working on a Twine, in which we will put each storymap as users interact with info about each industry.</li>

                <li>EB: [first week of april] I included Tyler's first Twine link, which will be the interactive aspect we're sharing during our presentation. I was also able to embed the Twine as an iframe element on the main page. </li>
                <li>EB: [mid april] I deleted the individual story maps from the main page because they are integrated into the Twine. Tyler has been updating the Twine to include images, and we will also integrate our video/audio interviews into our Twine and the text within it. I’ve also started collecting data from the union agreements available on Local 2110’s site. </li>
                <li>EB: [after class feedback] I added the main menu to our home page and created a separate HTML page for our progress report. I’ve added the navbar to our home page as well as the separate page for the twine. </li>
                <li>EB: [end of month] Throughout the semester I have been collecting data from the first union agreements of each workplace unionized with Local 2110 to understand what generally goes into a union agreement within our industries of focus. I compiled that data to find the most common articles within the union agreements and created an interactive graph using <a href src=”https://flourish.studio/”>Flourish</a> to visualize the most common articles.</li>
